```{r include = FALSE}
# This code block sets up the r session when the page is rendered to html
# include = FALSE means that it will not be included in the html document

# Write every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Write the results of every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)

# Define the directory where images generated by knit will be saved
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "images/01-C/")

# Set the web address where R will look for files from this repository
# Do not change this address

Today's class is an optional session for students who are new to R or who want a more formal introduction to R's terminology and data structures.


### Lesson Materials

We will be working through the Data Carpentry ecology lessons [Introduction to R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) and [Starting with data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html). Rather than reproduce the lesson materials here, you can find them at the links listed above.
