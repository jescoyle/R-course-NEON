From the initial working directory of the Student Workbook RStudio project, use the Terminal to:

1. Create a new directory inside the data directory named "derived"

2. Move a copy of the file intro-to-R_dat.csv into this new "derived" folder and append today's date to the end of the file name in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g.: intro-to-R_dat_2023-05-13.csv). Remember- avoid using spaces in file names!

3. Rename this file to add your initials to the end of the file name (e.g. intro-to-R_dat_2023-05-13_JRC.csv)

4. Delete the derived directory and all of its contents.

5. Type out the commands (in order) that you used to accomplish the prior steps. Write one command line for each of the four steps.
