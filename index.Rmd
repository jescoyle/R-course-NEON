## Overview
This is a self-paced tutorial adapted from [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) that teaches biologists basic data science and computing skills using  [National Ecological Observation Network](http://neonscience.org) data. It is being developed for use in an upper division Biology course at Saint Mary's College of California beginning in August 2023. **These materials are not currently ready for use.**


## Organization

### How to use this tutorial

This book is organized into sequential chapters with content that builds on prior chapters. Learners who have no prior experience with R should start with chapter 1 and progress through the book sequentially.

Access the chapters using the menu bar at the top of the website. Each chapter begins with an overview page that introduces the learning goals and important terms your will gain by working through the lesson. The Lesson tab for each chapter contains step-by-step instructions. Read through the lesson while running examples of code in RStudio on your own computer. Be sure to complete all of the challenges, as the contents of each challenge in the lessons build upon one another. Use the Exercises tab to practice the skills gained during the lesson. Most lessons were adapted from other sources- these are listed in the References tab along with other useful resources for readers wanting to learn more.
