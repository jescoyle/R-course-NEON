This page will give an overview of modules within this tutorial and learning objectives accomplished in each. It will correspond to the computing skills checklist used in the course.

## Core Modules

#### Module 1. Navigating your computer

- Files and directories
  - home directory
  - working directory
  - use the terminal in R studio to:
      - navigate
      - create and delete files
      - rename files
  - Manual download of data from NEON and save to a class folder
- Programs
  - programs are files written in executable code
  - we will learn to write small "programs" called "scripts"
    - you can write programs to automate tasks
    - you can write programs to make your scientific analyses reproducible



#### Module 2. Why R and RStudio?

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episodes 1, 2, 3

- R is a programming language
- RStudio is an IDE
  - various additional functionality of RStudio
- R can:
  - do computations
  - manipulate data
  - access files on your computer or the internet
  - make graphs
  - create documents
  - create apps
  - almost anything... though it is not always the best tool for every job.
- Why R?
  - R has a wide user community and will always be free
    - user contributed packages:
      -NEONUtilities
  - R and RStudio make it easy for anyone to reproduce your scientific analyses
  - It is (relatively) easy to get help with (almost) anything

#### Module 3. Data organization in spreadsheets

*from:* [@dc-spreadsheet-lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)

- Best practices in data table formatting
  - tidy tables
  - missing data
  - dates
  - text-based and avoids special characters
  - raw data vs. derived data and README files
- Spreadsheet program quality control features
- Data export from spreadsheet programs
- Text-based data tables: delimited formats
  - typical delimiter characters
  - white space characters: space, tab, new line
- Metadata



#### Module 4. R: Data structures and operations

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episodes 4, 5, 6, 11

- Basic data types in R
  - vectors vs. lists
  - dataframes vs. matrices
  - data types: numeric, character, factor, logical
- Reading data from a file
- Manipulating data frames
- Subsetting vectors and data frames


#### Module 5. R: Controlling program flow

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episode 7


#### Module 6. R: Simple graphs with ggplot2

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episode 8


#### Module 7. R: Vectorization and functions

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episodes 9, 10


- NEON Utilities functions & reading a function help file

#### Module 8. R: Complex graphs with ggplot2

#### Module 9. R: Data manipulation in the tidyverse


*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episodes 12, 13, 14


## Additional Modules

#### Module A. Producing reports with Rmd and knitr

*from:* [@swc-reproducible-lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) episode 15


#### Module B. R: Intro to geospatial raster data

*from:* [@dc-geospatial-concepts-lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/) and [@dc-geospatial-lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/index.html) episodes 1, 2, 3, 4
