# Introduction to Computing in R with NEON - Semester Course

This is a set of teaching materials adapted from [Data Carpentry lessons](http://datacarpentry.org/lessons) that teaches biologists basic data science and computing skills using data from the [National Ecological Observation Network](http://neonscience.org). Exercises are adapted from [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/). It is currently being developed for use in an upper division Biology course at Saint Mary's College of California beginning in August 2023. 


## Where is everything

Teaching materials are stored in `exercises/` and `lessons/`. Derived datasets from NEON are stored in `data/`. Files used in the course website are in `docs/` Images used on pages are stored in `images/`.

## Re-using this repository

This repository was built as an RStudio project and the course website is designed to be hosted from the `docs/` folder on the main branch on GitHub Pages. **These materials are not currently ready for reuse.** This README will be updated when they become available and a LISCENCE file will be added at that time.


## Acknowledgements

Thank you to [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) and [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) for providing open and remixable materials for scientists learning programming and data science. This course draws heavily from the [Data Carpentry for Biologists](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/) and [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/).
