<h2>Overview</h2>
<!-- Motivator-->
<blockquote>
<p>How much time have you wasted wondering just where that file you
downloaded went or which version of a paper you were working on? Have
you ever forgotten exactly what you did to make that graph for a report
and now need to make it again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A modern scientist must not only learn how the natural world works-
they also must be able to access and interact with the digital world
through a computer. However for many scientists, a computer is a
somewhat mysterious box of electronics that we learn how to interact
with in a piecemeal fashion, gradually learning the tools we need to do
our science. While most scientists don’t need to learn how the physical
hardware of their computer works, learning a little bit about how the
software that is programmed into our computers is structured can make it
much easier to create reproducible science in a world where all data
eventually becomes digital.</p>
<p>We’re going to get to know your computer by learning to navigate the
file system through a command line. In doing so, we will set up a
digital project that we will use for the rest of the chapters in this
book. Keeping your computer’s files tidy and organized is the first step
toward reproducible science and will save you time and energy.</p>
<p>A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help ensure the integrity of your data;</li>
<li>It makes it simpler to share your work with someone else (a
lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);</li>
<li>It makes it much easier to pick the project back up after a
break.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand how to set up a tidy project layout, we first need to
understand how your computer is structured.</p>
<div id="what-we-will-learn" class="section level3">
<h3>What we will learn</h3>
<p>In this lesson learners will:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the structure of the filesystem on a computer</li>
<li>use a command line interface to navigate the file system</li>
<li>describe the relationship between R and RStudio (an IDE)</li>
<li>set up an RStudio project</li>
</ul>
<div id="key-terms-commands" class="section level4">
<h4>Key Terms &amp; Commands</h4>
<p>You will learn these key terms as you work through this lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>file</li>
<li>file system</li>
<li>file path (relative vs. absolute)</li>
<li>directory</li>
<li>working directory vs. root directory</li>
<li>terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson introduces the following unix-style shell commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code></li>
<li><code>./</code></li>
<li><code>../</code></li>
<li><code>cd</code></li>
<li><code>ls</code></li>
<li><code>pwd</code></li>
<li><code>cp</code></li>
<li><code>mkdir</code></li>
<li><code>rm</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>We could learn about your computer’s <strong>file system</strong>
using applications that are already installed on your computer; e.g. the
File Explorer on Windows or the Finder on Mac. However, we’ll be using
RStudio to explore files on your computer because it has a built-in
command-line environment and file viewing window that we can use from
the same application. We’ll also be using RStudio to create a
self-contained, reproducible project that we will use for the rest of
this book.</p>
<p>Before beginning this lesson, make sure that your have the latest
version of R and RStudio (see <a href="computer-setup.html">Computer
Setup</a>) and that you know how to open your computers default file
browser.</p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<div id="orientation-to-the-rstudio-user-interface"
class="section level3">
<h3>Orientation to the RStudio user interface</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by opening RStudio. Find the RStudio application on your
computer and open it as you would any other application.</p>
<p><strong>Basic layout</strong></p>
<p>When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)</li>
<li>Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)</li>
<li>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your RStudio session should look similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="images/01-rstudio.png" alt="image of RStudio layout" /> If
you’re having trouble seeing the different windows, RStudio has several
<a
href="https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360044226673-RStudio-Accessibility-Features">accessibility
features</a> that allow you to change the size of text and simplify the
layout. You may want to customize your setup now.</p>
<p>We will go over each of these panels as we need to use them. For this
lesson, we will be using the <code>Files</code> and
<code>Terminal</code> panels to learn how to navigate your computer. We
will learn more about the <code>Console</code> and
<code>Environment</code> panels in the <a
href="chp-chp-intro-to-R.html">Intro to R</a>) lesson.</p>
</div>
<div id="navigating-the-file-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Navigating the file system</h3>
<p>A computer can do a lot of things, but one of its most basic
functions is to store <strong>files</strong>, encoded pieces of
information that you can interact with (e.g. documents, images,
programs, etc…). A computer organizes these files in a hierarchical
<strong>file system</strong> that helps the user know where to find
them. The file system contains folders and sub-folders that allow the
user to sort files according to their needs. The file system is
“hierarchical” because folders and files are always contained within a
folder at a higher level.</p>
<p>Another name for a folder on the file system is a
<strong>directory</strong> and there are a few special directories that
you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>root directory</strong> is the highest level folder on
the file system.</li>
<li>The <strong>working directory</strong> is the folder that you are
currently working in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the file browser that you use to access files on your computer.
On Mac this is usually the Finder application
(<img src="images/macOS-high-sierra-finder-topic-icon.png" height=18, width=18>).
On Windows this is the File Explorer application
(<img src="images/windows10_file_explorer_icon.png" height=18, width=18>).</p>
<p>Use your file browser to navigate to a folder where you typically
save files for school (or work). Keep track of the sequence of folders
that you clicked through to get there. The sequence of sub-folders used
to navigate to a particular file or folder is called a
<strong>path</strong> or <strong>file path</strong>. A path is an
address that tells a computer where to find a specific file or
directory. An <strong>absolute path</strong> is the full address of a
file or folder starting from the root directory. On the Windows File
Explorer, the path is shown in a bar across the top of the window. On
the Mac Finder, the path is shown in a bar across the bottom of the
window (if it is not there, you need to enable it by clicking View &gt;
Show Path Bar). The <code>&gt;</code> symbol is typically used to
separate sequential subfolders; the highest level folder is the
left-most and the name of the folder you are currently looking at is the
right-most.</p>
<p>Let’s use the <code>Files</code> panel in RStudio to view the file
system. When you first open RStudio the contents of the working
directory are shown in the <code>Files</code> panel. The absolute path
of the current directory you are viewing is shown in a bar across the
top. To navigate up or down the file system and view files in different
folders, you can click on the names of higher-level folders in the path
or you can click on subfolders inside the the window.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Find your Downloads folder</p>
<p>When you download a file from the internet where does it go? Most
computers have a default directory where downloaded files are saved. It
can be very useful to know where this directory is located on your file
system.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the file browser on your computer (Finder on Mac or File
Explorer on Windows) to locate your default Downloads folder. What path
does your file browser give for this folder?</li>
<li>Now use the file browser built into RStudio to find the same
Downloads folder. If you have trouble navigating using the RStudio file
explorer, click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the
<code>Files</code> panel to use your computer’s default file
browser.</li>
<li>Type out the absolute path to your downloads folder.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-the-command-line-to-navigate" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the command line to navigate</h3>
<p>The first step in to learning to write programs is learning how to
navigate the file system using text commands. A computer has a program
called a <strong>shell</strong> that can interact with the file system
(e.g. create, edit and delete files and directories). We will use a
<strong>terminal</strong> to interact with this shell. The terminal
provides a graphical window so we can see the commands that we type to
the shell and the output these commands produce. We’re going to learn a
few commands used in unix-style shells because these are the ones
typically used by scientists for computing. RStudio uses a unix-style
shell regardless of your computer’s operating system (e.g. Windows or
Mac).</p>
<p>Open the terminal in RStudio. It should be listed as a tab in the
left panel. If not, use the top menu bar to select View &gt; Move Focus
to Terminal.</p>
<p>You should see <code>$</code> followed a blinking cursor. This is the
<strong>command line</strong>. It is where we will type commands to tell
the shell how to interact with the file system.</p>
<p>The colored line of text above or to the left of the command line
gives your username and your computer’s name as well as the path to your
current <strong>working directory</strong>. Notice that subfolders in
the path are separated by slashes <code>/</code>. The path also begins
with a <code>~</code>. This denotes that the path is relative to the
user’s <strong>home directory</strong>. A home directory is the folder
where all of a particular user’s documents are stored. A computer can
have multiple users who log in using different usernames. Each user will
have a different home directory.</p>
<p>What is the absolute path of the current working directory (the
directory we are currently in)?</p>
<p>Type <code>pwd</code> into the command line (stands for “present
working directory”). Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
<p>The terminal will print some text with the absolute path to the
current working directory. It will start with a <code>/</code> to denote
the root directory and subfolders will be separated by forward slashes
<code>/</code>.</p>
<p>What files and folders are in this directory? To see, type
<code>ls</code> into the command line and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
“list” the files.</p>
<p>The names of files will be in black and the names of directories will
be in a different color and will end with a <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s navigate into a subfolder. Type the command <code>cd</code>
followed by the name of a subfolder to “change directories” to that
folder. If there are spaces in the name of the folder, you need to
surround the folder name with quotes: For example
<code>cd Documents</code> or <code>cd "My Documents"</code>.</p>
<p>Now what is the current working directory? Check using the
<code>pwd</code> command.</p>
<p>To go back up a level to the next higher directory (called the
<strong>parent directory</strong>), use <code>../</code>:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>`cd ../`</code></pre>
<p>In fact, we can use <code>cd</code> to navigate to any folder by
typing its absolute path after the <code>cd</code> command. For example:
<code>cd "/c/Documents/My subfolder/another subfolder"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When typing commands into a command line
you (usually) must copy the code exactly as it is written including all
of the same spaces, spelling and capitalization. If you get an error,
first check to see that you typed the correct command.</p>
<div class="callout-trick">
<p>You can get your file browser to display the text-based file path to
any folder as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: Click inside the file path bar. The absolute path will be
displayed using a backslash ’' symbol between sequential subfolders. For
example: <code>C:\Users\username</code>. You need to change the back
slashes to forward slashes before using it in the command line.</li>
<li>Mac: ctr+click on the file you want inside the Finder path bar.
Select Copy as Pathname and paste it into the command line as is.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Navigate to your Downloads folder</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a command that would navigate directly to your Downloads
folder no matter what directory you are currently in.</li>
<li>Try it out from your current working directory to see if it
works.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Rather than type out the full absolute path every time we need to
navigate to a new folder, we can use a <strong>relative path</strong> to
specify the location of a file or folder relative to the current working
directory.</p>
<p>The current working directory is denoted <code>./</code>, so
<code>./Documents</code> specifies the Documents subfolder within the
current working directory. In contrast <code>../Documents</code>
specifies a Documents folder that is located in the next folder above
the current working directory. So since <code>../</code> is the parent,
<code>../Documents</code> would be a sibling directory of the current
working directory.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Navigate to your Downloads folder</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a command that would navigate to your Downloads folder from
your Home directory.</li>
<li>Navigate to your Home directory and try it out.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="callout-trick">
<p>You don’t need to type out long file path names at the command line.
Start by typing a few letters of the file path your want, then press
tab. If there is only one name in the current directory that starts with
those letters, the command line will automatically complete the name for
you. If nothing appears, try typing a few more letters and pressing tab
again, or check to make sure your spelling is correct. This is called
<strong>tab completion</strong> and can be used throughout RStudio.</p>
<p>If your Terminal window gets stuck and the command line looks like
this <code>&gt;</code> that means it is waiting for further input. If
you didn’t mean to add anything else, you can <strong>escape</strong>
the current command and reset the command line by typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>c</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> (Mac).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-an-rstudio-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating an RStudio project</h3>
<p>RStudio projects are a useful way to keep all of the files needed for
a particular project together in one place. RStudio projects can be
easily shared with others because they set up the RStudio session in the
same way regardless of who opens the project.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Create a new project in RStudio</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.</li>
<li>Click “New Directory”.</li>
<li>Click “New Project”.</li>
<li>Type in the name of the directory to store your project. This can be
any name using letters or numbers, but it should not have any spaces.
For example, try “my-sandbox”.</li>
<li>Click the “Create Project” button.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>You should now be looking at a new RStudio session and in the upper
right corner of the window you will see this the name of your project:
<img src="images/RStudio_project_label.jpg"
alt="image of RStudio project label" /></p>
<p>You will also see a mostly empty folder in the Files panel. There
should be one file with the name of the project: my-sandbox.Rproj</p>
<p>This file contains information that RStudio needs to set up your
project. One thing the .Rproj file will do is set your working directory
to be the same directory that the .Rproj file is located in. Let’s see
how this works.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Display the working directory in the Terminal and R Console</p>
<p>What command should you use in the terminal to display the path of
the current working directory?</p>

<summary>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
</summary>
<div class="solution">
<pre class="bash"><code>  pwd</code></pre>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>We can also show the working directory in the R Console. Click the
Console tab next to the Terminal tab. This command line let’s you
interact with R (which we will learn more about in future chapters).
Notice that the command line begins with <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Display the working directory in the R Console.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Type <code>getwd()</code>.</li>
<li>What do you see? How is it similar to and different from what the
Terminal displays?</li>
<li>How would the file path be different on someone else’s computer? How
would it be similar?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>RStudio projects are useful because they automatically open in the
same working directory regardless of the computer they are located on.
This means that when we start writing code, we can refer to the location
of files relative to the directory where the .Rproj file is saved and
the code will work on any computer. Let’s see how this might work.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Opening an RStudio project through the file system</p>

<li>Move the entire my-sandbox folder to a folder on your computer where
you are saving work for this class.</li>
<li>Open the my-sandbox folder and double click on the
<code>.Rproj</code> file in that directory.</li>
<li>Observe the Files panel in RStudio. What has changed?</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and the R Console to display the current working

class="section level4">
<h4>Best practices for project organization</h4>
<p>Although there is no “best” way to lay out a project, there are some
general principles to adhere to that will make project management
easier:</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf">Good
Enough Practices for Scientific Computing</a> gives the following
recommendations for project organization:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the
project.</li>
<li>Put text documents associated with the project in the
<code>doc</code> directory.</li>
<li>Put raw data and metadata in the <code>data</code> directory, and
files generated during cleanup and analysis in a <code>results</code>
directory.</li>
<li>Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the
<code>src</code> directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or
compiled locally in the <code>bin</code> directory.</li>
<li>Name all files to reflect their content or function.</li>
</ol>
<p>The workbook for this course is an RStudio project that follows these
guidelines. If you haven’t already done so, <a
href="computer-setup.html##Course-Workbook">set up the workbook for this
course</a>.</p>
<p>Close RStudio and use your computer’s file browser to navigate to the
directory where you saved the R-course-NEON-workbook project. Open the
project by clicking on the .Rproj file.</p>
<p>The Files panel in RStudio should now look like this: &gt; <img
src="images/RStudio_project_subfolders.jpg"
alt="image of contents of R-course-NEON project folder" /></p>
<p>The exercises folder contains files that you will use to complete the
exercises at the end of each lesson. These are text files that you can
edit to solve the problems described in the Exercises section. Let’s
make a copy of each of these files so that if you make changes to them,
you still have the original version. Although you could do this with
your file browser, we will learn how to do this using the terminal in
order to introduce some useful new commands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="working-with-files-on-the-command-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Working with files on the command line</h3>
<!-- set the chunk working directory to the workbook to mirror what the student sees -->
<p>The terminal provides a quick way to create and remove files and
directories. It is particularly useful to use the terminal when we need
to work on a lot of files at once.</p>
<p>Let’s use the terminal to create two new folders: one for copies of
the exercises that you are working on and one for the exercise files
once you have finished them. The command to “make a directory” is
<code>mkdir</code> followed by the name of the folder you wish to
create.</p>
<p>Execute the command <code>mkdir working</code> in the terminal. (To
“execute” a command, type it at the command prompt and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>.)</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>mkdir working</code></pre>
<p>Where did the new directory end up? It should have been created in
the current working directory. However, it would be more logical to
place this directory inside the exercises folder. You could navigate to
the exercises folder and then run the <code>mkdir</code> command again,
or you can specify the path to the new folder you wish to create.</p>
<p>Create a new folder called working inside the exercises folder by
executing this command in the terminal:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>mkdir exercises/working</code></pre>
<p>Check the Files window to verify that you created a folder named
working inside the exercises folder.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Create a new folder</p>
Use the terminal to make a new folder named “finished” inside the
exercises folder.
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
</summary>
<div class="solution">
<pre class="sh"><code>mkdir exercises/finished</code></pre>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="callout-trick">
<p>If you want to rerun a similar command, you don’t need to type it out
again. Place your cursor at the command line and press the up arrow key.
This will bring up the most recent command, If you press it again, it
will go back through your commands one at time. When you find the one
you want, you can run it as-is by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or edit it
first, then run it.</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s remove the working folder that we not longer need that is not
in the exercises folder. The command to “remove” a file or folder is
<code>rm</code>.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>rm working</code></pre>
<pre><code>rm: cannot remove &#39;working&#39;: Is a directory</code></pre>
<p>Oops it didn’t work! You got an error message saying that it could
not remove working because it is a directory. We need to add an option
to allow the function to “recursively” delete sub directories and files
within them. Command options are specified after the command with a
<code>-</code>. The command to delete the directory named working and
all of its contents is:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>rm -r working</code></pre>
<p>What else can the <code>rm</code> command do? Are there any other
options? If you’re interested in learning about the functionality of a
unix command, you can always use the internet, but there is also a
built-in help file attached to every command. Use the
<code>--help</code> option to access it.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>rm --help</code></pre>
<pre><code>Usage: rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

  -f, --force           ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
  -i                    prompt before every removal
  -I                    prompt once before removing more than three files, or
                          when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i,
                          while still giving protection against most mistakes
      --interactive[=WHEN]  prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or
                          always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always
      --one-file-system  when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any
                          directory that is on a file system different from
                          that of the corresponding command line argument
      --no-preserve-root  do not treat &#39;/&#39; specially
      --preserve-root[=all]  do not remove &#39;/&#39; (default);
                              with &#39;all&#39;, reject any command line argument
                              on a separate device from its parent
  -r, -R, --recursive   remove directories and their contents recursively
  -d, --dir             remove empty directories
  -v, --verbose         explain what is being done
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R)
option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

To remove a file whose name starts with a &#39;-&#39;, for example &#39;-foo&#39;,
use one of these commands:
  rm -- -foo

  rm ./-foo

Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover
some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater
assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

<p>We see a table of the different options and then at the end tells us:
“By default, rm does not remove directories. Use the –recursive (-r or
-R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its
contents.”</p>
<p>Now let’s copy the exercises for lesson 1 into exercises/working. The
command to copy a file is <code>cp SOURCE DEST</code>, where we replace
<code>SOURCE</code> with the name(s) of the files to copy and
<code>DEST</code> with the name of the directory to copy them into.</p>
<p>First we need to know the names of the files.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<p>Use the terminal to list all of the files in the exercises
folder.</p>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
</summary>
<div class="solution">
<p>Your answer will depend on your current working directory (check
using <code>pwd</code>):</p>
<p>If your working directory is the main R-course-NEON-workbook folder,
then type:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>ls exercises</code></pre>
<p>If your working directory is the R-course-NEON-workbook/exercises
folder, then type:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>ls </code></pre>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>When the list of files prints, you will see that each exercises is
named according to its number. All of the exercises for lesson 1 start
with 1.</p>
<p>Let’s copy one of the files from the exercises folder into the
working subfolder. Note that this code assumes you are in the main
R-course-NEON-workbook folder.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cp exercises/1.1.txt exercises/working/
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>/</code> at the end of the name of the folder. If we
had typed <code>cp 1.1.txt exercises/working</code>, it would have
copied 1.1.txt into a new file named exercises and overwritten the
folder named exercises.</p>
<p>Use the Files window in RStudio to check to see that this worked.
There should now be a file named 1.1.txt inside the working subfolder of
the exercises folder.</p>
<p>The real power of the terminal is that it lets us work with many
files at once, instead of copying them one at a time. Let’s copy all of
the exercise files for lesson 1 into the working folder.</p>
<p>We will use a <strong>wildcard</strong> to select only the files that
begin with the number 1. The <code>*</code> symbol is used to match any
character. <code>ls 1.*</code> would list all files that begin with 1.
inside the current working directory.</p>
<p>First let’s move into tho exercises folder so that we don’t need to
include the exercises folder in the command. Then, list all files that
begin with 1.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>cd exercises

ls 1.*</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.1.txt
1.2.txt
1.3.txt
1.4.txt</code></pre>
<p>Wildcards can be used with other commands and allow us to copy and
move a set of files that match a particular naming pattern.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the terminal to check your current working directory and
navigate to the exercises folder (if needed).</li>
<li>List the files for exercises in lesson 1 (these begin with 1.).</li>
<li>Copy these files into the working folder inside the exercises
folder.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Solution:</strong>
</summary>
<div class="solution">
<p>Commands are shown below without their output.</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>pwd

cd exercises

ls 1.*

cp 1.* working/
</code></pre>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<div class="callout-important">
<p>Be careful- if you copy a file into a directory where a file with the
same name exists, it will automatically write over the file (unless you
use an option to tell it not to, see <code>cp --help</code> for more
information). <strong>It will not warn you before doing so.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Suppose we wanted to share these files with another person who has
different versions of the same files. It would be useful to change the
file name to indicate which ones are yours. Let’s rename all of the
files with your initials.</p>
<p>The <code>cp</code> command would allow us to make a copy with a
different name, but then we would need to delete the old version. The
<code>mv SOURCE DEST</code> command allows us to “move” files from a
SOURCE location to the DEST location without keeping the old version.
This allows us to change the name of a file. For example, if my initials
are XXX:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>mv exercises/working/1.1.txt exercises/working/1.1_XXX.txt

ls exercises/working</code></pre>
<pre><code>1.1_XXX.txt
1.2.txt
1.3.txt
1.4.txt</code></pre>
<div class="challenge">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Rename all of the lesson 1 exercises in the working folder with your
initials.</li>
<li>What trick did you (or could you) use to accomplish this
quickly?</li>
<li>What would make this process faster?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Computers are really good at doing the same thing (with slight
changes) over and over again. In future lessons we will learn how to
automate the process of repeating the same command many times using code
(see <a href="chp-program-flow.html">Program flow</a>).</p>
<p>This concludes the first lesson. To practice what you have learned,
navigate to the exercises tab. Each exercise is accompanied by a file in
the exercises folder. You can make your own copy of each of these files
and save them in a working folder until they are complete (after which
you can move them to a “finished” folder to stay organized).</p>
<p>To open an exercise file, click on it in the Files window of RStudio.
This will open a new window (called the Source window) showing you the
contents of the file. Exercise files are comprised of text that you can
edit and save. You can type into this window as you normally would in
any text editor. To save your work click File &gt; Save (or click the
save icon
