<p><strong>THIS LESSON IS NOT YET READY FOR LEARNERS.</strong></p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<!--### Motivator-->
<blockquote>
<p>How much time have you wasted wondering just where that file you
downloaded went or which version of a paper you were working on? Have
you ever forgotten exactly what you did to make that graph for a report
and now need to make it again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A modern scientist must not only learn how the natural world works-
they also must be able to access and interact with the digital world
through a computer. However for many scientists, a computer is a
somewhat mysterious box of electronics that we learn how to interact
with in a piecemeal fashion, gradually learning the tools we need to do
our science. While most scientists don’t need to learn how the physical
hardware of their computer works, learning a little bit about how the
software that is programmed into our computers is structured can make it
much easier to create reproducible science in a world where all data
eventually becomes digital.</p>
<p>We’re going to get to know your computer by learning to navigate the
file system through a command line. In doing so, we will set up a
digital project that we will use for the rest of the chapters in this
book. Keeping your computer’s files tidy and organized is the first step
toward reproducible science and will save you time and energy.</p>
<p>A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help ensure the integrity of your data;</li>
<li>It makes it simpler to share your work with someone else (a
lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);</li>
<li>It makes it much easier to pick the project back up after a
break.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand how to set up a tidy project layout, we first need to
understand how your computer is structured.</p>
<div id="what-we-will-learn" class="section level3">
<h3>What we will learn</h3>
<p>In this lesson learners will:</p>
<ul>
<li>describe the structure of the filesystem on a computer</li>
<li>use a command line interface to navigate the file system</li>
<li>describe the relationship between R and RStudio (an IDE)</li>
<li>set up an RStudio project</li>
</ul>
<div id="key-terms-commands" class="section level4">
<h4>Key Terms &amp; Commands</h4>
<p>You will learn these key terms as you work through this lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>file</li>
<li>file system</li>
<li>file path (relative vs. absolute)</li>
<li>directory</li>
<li>working directory vs. root directory</li>
<li>terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>This lesson introduces the following unix-style shell commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code></li>
<li><code>./</code></li>
<li><code>../</code></li>
<li><code>cd</code></li>
<li><code>ls</code></li>

<li><code>mkdir</code></li>
<li><code>rm</code></li>
</ul>

<div id="prerequisites" class="section level3">
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>We could learn about your computer’s <strong>file system</strong>
using applications that are already installed on your computer; e.g. the
File Explorer on Windows or the Finder on Mac. However, we’ll be using
RStudio to explore files on your computer because it has a built-in
command-line environment and file viewing window that we can use from
the same application. We’ll also be using RStudio to create a
self-contained, reproducible project that we will use for the rest of
this book.</p>
<p>Before beginning this lesson, make sure that your have the latest
version of R and RStudio (see <a href="computer-setup.html">Computer
Setup</a>) and that you know how to open your computers default file
browser.</p>

<div id="orientation-to-the-rstudio-user-interface"
class="section level3">
<h3>Orientation to the RStudio user interface</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by opening RStudio. Find the RStudio application on your
computer and open it as you would any other application.</p>
<p><strong>Basic layout</strong></p>
<p>When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)</li>
<li>Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)</li>
<li>Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your RStudio session should look similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="images/01-rstudio.png" alt="image of RStudio layout" /></p>
<p>We will go over each of these panels as we need to use them. For this
lesson, we will be using the <code>Files</code> and
<code>Terminal</code> panels to learn how to navigate your computer. We
will learn more about the <code>Console</code> and
<code>Environment</code> panels in the <a
href="chp-intro-to-R.html">Intro to R and RStudio</a> lesson.</p>
</div>
<div id="navigating-the-file-system" class="section level3">
<h3>Navigating the file system</h3>
<p>A computer can do a lot of things, but one of its most basic
functions is to store <strong>files</strong>, encoded pieces of
information that you can interact with (e.g. documents, images,
programs, etc…). A computer organizes these files in a hierarchical
<strong>file system</strong> that helps the user know where to find
them. The file system contains folders and sub-folders that allow the
user to sort files according to their needs. The file system is
“hierarchical” because folders and files are always contained within a
folder at a higher level.</p>
<p>Another name for a folder on the file system is a
<strong>directory</strong> and there are a few special directories that
you should know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>root directory</strong> is the highest level folder on
the file system.</li>
<li>The <strong>working directory</strong> is the folder that you are
currently working in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open the file browser that you use to access files on your computer.
On Mac this is usually the Finder application
(<img src="images/macOS-high-sierra-finder-topic-icon.png" height=18, width=18>).
On Windows this is the File Explorer application
(<img src="images/windows10_file_explorer_icon.png" height=18, width=18>).</p>
<p>Use your file browser to navigate to a folder where you typically
save files for school (or work). Keep track of the sequence of folders
that you clicked through to get there. The sequence of sub-folders used
to navigate to a particular file or folder is called a
<strong>path</strong> or <strong>file path</strong>. A path is an
address that tells a computer where to find a specific file or
directory. An <strong>absolute path</strong> is the full address of a
file or folder starting from the root directory. On the Windows File
Explorer, the path is shown in a bar across the top of the window. On
the Mac Finder, the path is shown in a bar across the bottom of the
window (if it is not there, you need to enable it by clicking View &gt;
Show Path Bar). The <code>&gt;</code> symbol is typically used to
separate sequential subfolders; the highest level folder is the
left-most and the name of the folder you are currently looking at is the
right-most.</p>
<p>Let’s use the <code>Files</code> panel in RStudio to view the file
system. When you first open RStudio the contents of the working
directory are shown in the <code>Files</code> panel. The absolute path
of the current directory you are viewing is shown in a bar across the
top. To navigate up or down the file system and view files in different
folders, you can click on the names of higher-level folders in the path
or you can click on subfolders inside the the window.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Find your Downloads folder</p>
<p>When you download a file from the internet where does it go? Most
computers have a default directory where downloaded files are saved. It
can be very useful to know where this directory is located on your file
system.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the file browser on your computer (Finder on Mac or File
Explorer on Windows) to locate your default Downloads folder. What path
does your file browser give for this folder?</li>
<li>Now use the file browser built into RStudio to find the same
Downloads folder. If you have trouble navigating using the RStudio file
explorer, click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the
<code>Files</code> panel to use your computer’s default file
browser.</li>
<li>Type out the absolute path to your downloads folder.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="using-the-command-line-to-navigate" class="section level3">
<h3>Using the command line to navigate</h3>
<p>The first step in to learning to write programs is learning how to
navigate the file system using text commands. A computer has a program
called a <strong>shell</strong> that can interact with the file system
(e.g. create, edit and delete files and directories). We will use a
<strong>terminal</strong> to interact with this shell. The terminal
provides a graphical window so we can see the commands that we type to
the shell and the output these commands produce. We’re going to learn a
few commands used in unix-style shells because these are the ones
typically used by scientists for computing. RStudio uses a unix-style
shell regardless of your computer’s operating system (e.g. Windows or
Mac).</p>
<p>Open the terminal in RStudio. It should be listed as a tab in the
left panel. If not, use the top menu bar to select View &gt; Move Focus
to Terminal.</p>
<p>You should see <code>$</code> followed a blinking cursor. This is the
<strong>command line</strong>. It is where we will type commands to tell
the shell how to interact with the file system.</p>
<p>The colored line of text above or to the left of the command line
gives your username and your computer’s name as well as the path to your
current <strong>working directory</strong>. Notice that subfolders in
the path are separated by slashes <code>/</code>. The path also begins
with a <code>~</code>. This denotes that the path is relative to the
user’s <strong>home directory</strong>. A home directory is the folder
where all of a particular user’s documents are stored. A computer can
have multiple users who log in using different usernames. Each user will
have a different home directory.</p>
<p>What is the absolute path of the current working directory (the
directory we are currently in)?</p>
<p>Type <code>pwd</code> into the command line (stands for “present
working directory”). Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
<p>The terminal will print some text with the absolute path to the
current working directory. It will start with a <code>/</code> to denote
the root directory and subfolders will be separated by forward slashes
<code>/</code>.</p>
<p>What files and folders are in this directory? To see, type
<code>ls</code> into the command line and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to
“list” the files.</p>
<p>The names of files will be in black and the names of directories will
be in a different color and will end with a <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s navigate into a subfolder. Type the command <code>cd</code>
followed by the name of a subfolder to “change directories” to that
folder. If there are spaces in the name of the folder, you need to
surround the folder name with quotes: For example
<code>cd Documents</code> or <code>cd "My Documents"</code>.</p>
<p>Now what is the current working directory? Check using the
<code>pwd</code> command.</p>
<p>To go back up a level to the next higher directory (called the
<strong>parent directory</strong>), use <code>../</code>:</p>
<p><code>cd ../</code></p>
<p>In fact, we can use <code>cd</code> to navigate to any folder by
typing its absolute path after the <code>cd</code> command. For example:
<code>cd "/c/Documents/My subfolder/another subfolder"</code>.</p>
<p>FYI: You can get your file browser to display the text-based file
path to any folder as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: Click inside the file path bar. The absolute path will be
displayed using a backslash ’' symbol between sequential subfolders. For
example: <code>C:\Users\username</code>. You need to change the back
slashes to forward slashes before using it in the command line.</li>
<li>Mac: ctr+click on the file you want inside the Finder path bar.
Select Copy as Pathname and paste it into the command line as is.</li>
</ul>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Navigate to your Downloads folder</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a command that would navigate directly to your Downloads
folder no matter what directory you are currently in.</li>
<li>Try it out from your current working directory to see if it
works.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Rather than type out the full absolute path every time we need to
navigate to a new folder, we can use a <strong>relative path</strong> to
specify the location of a file or folder relative to the current working
directory.</p>
<p>The current working directory is denoted <code>./</code>, so
<code>./Documents</code> specifies the Documents subfolder within the
current working directory. In contrast <code>../Documents</code>
specifies a Documents folder that is located in the next folder above
the current working directory. So since <code>../</code> is the parent,
<code>../Documents</code> would be a sibling directory of the current
working directory.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Navigate to your Downloads folder</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a command that would navigate to your Downloads folder from
your Home directory.</li>
<li>Navigate to your Home directory and try it out.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="callout-trick">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HELPFUL TRICKS</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to type out long file path names at the command line.
Start by typing a few letters of the file path your want, then press
tab. If there is only one name in the current directory that starts with
those letters, the command line will automatically complete the name for
you. If nothing appears, try typing a few more letters and pressing tab
again, or check to make sure your spelling is correct. This is called
<strong>tab completion</strong> and can be used throughout RStudio.</p>
<p>If your Terminal window gets stuck and the command line looks like
this <code>&gt;</code> that means it is waiting for further input. If
you didn’t mean to add anything else, you can <strong>escape</strong>
the current command and reset the command line by typing <kbd>ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>c</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> (Mac).</p>

<h3>Creating an RStudio project</h3>
<p>RStudio projects are a useful way to keep all of the files needed for
a particular project together in one place. RStudio projects can be
easily shared with others because they set up the RStudio session in the
same way regardless of who opens the project.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Create a new project in RStudio</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.</li>
<li>Click “New Directory”.</li>
<li>Click “New Project”.</li>
<li>Type in the name of the directory to store your project. This can be
any name using letters or numbers, but it should not have any spaces.
For example, try “my-sandbox”.</li>
<li>Click the “Create Project” button.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>You should now be looking at a new RStudio session and in the upper
right corner of the window you will see this the name of your project:
<img src="images/RStudio_project_label.jpg"
alt="image of RStudio project label" /></p>
<p>You will also see a mostly empty folder in the Files panel. There
should be one file with the name of the project: my-sandbox.Rproj</p>
<p>This file contains information that RStudio needs to set up your
project. One thing the .Rproj file will do is set your working directory
to be the same directory that the .Rproj file is located in. Let’s see
how this works.</p>

<p>RStudio projects are useful because they automatically open in the
same working directory regardless of the computer they are located on.
This means that when we start writing code, we can refer to the location
of files relative to the directory where the .Rproj file is saved and
the code will work on any computer. Let’s see how this might work.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Opening an RStudio project through the

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Exit RStudio.</li>
<li>Use your computer’s file browser to navigate to the directory where
you created the my-sandbox project. This should be your Desktop folder
if you followed the steps above.</li>
<li>Move the entire my-sandbox folder to a folder on your computer where
you are saving work for this class.</li>
<li>Open the my-sandbox folder and double click on the
<code>.Rproj</code> file in that directory.</li>
<li>Observe the Files panel in RStudio. What has changed?</li>
<li>Use the Terminal and the R Console to display the current working
directory. What has changed?</li>

<h4>Best practices for project organization</h4>
<p>Although there is no “best” way to lay out a project, there are some
general principles to adhere to that will make project management
easier:</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf">Good
Enough Practices for Scientific Computing</a> gives the following
recommendations for project organization:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the
project.</li>
<li>Put text documents associated with the project in the
<code>doc</code> directory.</li>
<li>Put raw data and metadata in the <code>data</code> directory, and
files generated during cleanup and analysis in a <code>results</code>
directory.</li>
<li>Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the
<code>src</code> directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or
compiled locally in the <code>bin</code> directory.</li>
<li>Name all files to reflect their content or function.</li>
</ol>
<p>The workbook for this course is an RStudio project that follows these
guidelines. If you haven’t already done so, <a
href="computer-setup.html##Course-Workbook">set up the workbook for this
course</a>.</p>
<p>Close RStudio and use your computer’s file browser to navigate to the
directory where you saved the R-course-NEON-workbook project. Open the
project by clicking on the .Rproj file.</p>
<p>The Files panel in RStudio should now look like this: &gt; <img
src="images/RStudio_project_subfolders.jpg"
alt="image of contents of R-course-NEON project folder" /></p>
<p>The exercises folder contains files that you will use to complete the
exercises at the end of each lesson. These are text files that you can
edit to solve the problems described in the Exercises section. Let’s
make a copy of each of these files so that if you make changes to them,
you still have the original version. Although you could do this with
your file browser, we will learn how to do this using the terminal in
order to introduce some useful new commands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="working-with-files-on-the-command-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Working with files on the command line</h3>
<p>The terminal provides a quick way to create and remove files and
directories. It is particularly useful to use the terminal when we need
to work on a lot of files at once.</p>
<p>Let’s use the terminal to create two new folders: one for copies of
the exercises that you are working on and one for the exercise files
once you have finished them. The command to “make a directory” is
<code>mkdir</code> followed by the name of the folder you wish to
create.</p>
<p>Execute the command <code>mkdir working</code> in the terminal. (To
“execute” a command, type it at the command prompt and press
<kbd>Enter</kbd>.)</p>
<p>Where did the new directory end up? It should have been created in
the current working directory. However, it would be more logical to
place this directory inside the exercises folder. You could navigate to
the exercises folder and then run the <code>mkdir</code> command again,
or you can specify the path to the new folder you wish to create.</p>
<p>Create a new folder called working inside the exercises folder by
executing this command in the terminal:
<code>mkdir exercises/working</code>.</p>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Creating new folders</p>
<p>Use the terminal to make a new folder named “finished” inside the
exercises folder.</p>
<p><strong>HELPFUL TRICK:</strong> If you want to rerun a similar
command, you don’t need to type it out again. Place your cursor at the
command line and press the up arrow key. This will bring up the most
recent command, If you press it again, it will go back through your
commands one at time. When you find the one you want, you can run it
as-is by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or edit it first, then run it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Let’s remove the working folder that we not longer need. The command
to “remove” a file or folder is <code>rm</code>. Execute the command
<code>rm working</code>.</p>
<p>Oops it didn’t work! You got an error message saying that it could
not remove working because it is a directory. We need to add an option
to allow the function to “recursively” delete subdirectories and files
within them. Command options are specified after the command withe a
<code>-</code>. The command to delete the directory named working and
all of its contents is: <code>rm -r working</code></p>
<p>What else can the <code>rm</code> command do? Are there any other
options? If you’re interested in learning about the functionality of a
unix command, you can always use the internet, but there is also a
built-in help file attached to every command. Use the
<code>--help</code> option to access it. For example,
<code>rm --help</code> shows us a table of the different options and
then at the end tells us: “By default, rm does not remove directories.
Use the –recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory,
too, along with all of its contents.”</p>
<p>Now let’s copy the exercises for lesson 1 into exercises/working. The
command to copy a file is <code>cp SOURCE DEST</code>, where we replace
<code>SOURCE</code> with the name(s) of the files to copy and
<code>DEST</code> with the name of the directory to copy them into.</p>
<p>First we need to know the names of the files.</p>
<div class="{challenge}">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Execute a command in the terminal that
will list all of the files in the exercises folder.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="solution">
<p>Your answer will depend on your current working directory (check
using <code>pwd</code>): If your working directory is the main
R-course-NEON-workbook folder, then type:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ls exercises</code></pre>
<p>If your working directory is the R-course-NEON-workbook/exercises
folder, then type:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>ls </code></pre>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>When the list of files prints, you will see that each exercises is
named according to its number. All of the exercises for lesson 1 start
with 1.</p>
<p>We will use a <strong>wildcard</strong> to select only the files that
begin with the number 1.</p>
<p>ls 1.*</p>
<div class="challenge">
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Copy multiple files into a directory</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Be careful- if you copy a file into a directory where a file with the
same name exists, it will automatically write over the file (unless you
use an option to tell it not to, see <code>cp --help</code> for more
information).</p>
<p>Rename with your initials. (use variable assignment)</p>
<p>Open the first exercise.</p>
